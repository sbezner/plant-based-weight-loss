You’ve gone plant-based but the scale isn’t budging. Sound familiar? Many people struggle with weight loss even on a vegan diet. Here’s why — and how to fix it.

## 1. Too Much Processed Vegan Food
Vegan doesn’t always mean healthy. Chips, cookies, and fake meats are often high in calories and low in nutrients.

✅ **Fix**: Focus on whole foods — beans, grains, veggies, fruits.

## 2. Not Enough Protein
Low protein can lead to muscle loss and slow metabolism.

✅ **Fix**: Include lentils, tofu, tempeh, and legumes in every meal.

## 3. Overeating Healthy Foods
Yes, you can overeat avocados and nut butters.

✅ **Fix**: Watch portion sizes of high-fat plant foods.

## 4. Liquid Calories
Smoothies, juices, and plant milks can be sneaky calorie bombs.

✅ **Fix**: Track or reduce liquid calories.

## 5. No Exercise
Even a clean diet works better when paired with movement.

✅ **Fix**: Walk daily. Add strength training.
